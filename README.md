# Advent of Code 2022
 
This year: Go!

# Daily Themes and Stars

1. `**` Parsing input, simple loops, arrays, finding the max and sum of a small data set
2. `**` Conditions, cases, small problems with many solutions (like FizzBuzz, where you want a clever one-liner but don't need it)
3. `**` ASCII, strings, set intersection, composable functions (`f(f(x,y),z)`)

# Lessons Learned
* Go is a really low-level language and does not provide batteries for things like `sum()` and `Set()`.
* Go ranges are `[inclusive:exclusive]`
